Homebrew-forensics
==================

This repository contains unofficial formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) related to digital forensics. In particular, this repository focuses on things that may not be considered as [acceptable formulae](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Acceptable-Formula).

Installing Homebrew-forensics formulae
--------------------------------------

Just `brew tap anarchivist/forensics` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one in mxcl/master, you can `brew install anarchivist/forensics/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

     brew install https://raw.github.com/anarchivist/homebrew-forensics/master/<directory>/<formula>.rb
