Homebrew-forensics
==================

This repository contains unofficial formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) related to digital forensics. In particular, this repository focuses on things that may not be considered as [acceptable formulae](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Acceptable-Formula).

You can also install via URL:
